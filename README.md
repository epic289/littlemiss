Collection of my progress on learning java and eventually other languages.

##About Me
I am an inquizitive person determined to learn every program language.
I currently know a portion of the java language. 
Programming to me means more than just typing up a program, I believe I have power in my hands to change the world.
My way of changing the world will start with learning each computer language, then working jobs that involve children or information technology.
My plan is to gain enough experience with children and I.T. to join the FBI cyber crimes division. Once I achieve that goal I want to specialize in child crime.
